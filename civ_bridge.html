<h1>CIV102 Bridge Project</h1>
<p>The CIV102 bridge is probably the most iconic project for first year students in Engineering Science at UofT.
    In the twilight before the finals of the first semester, we suddenly were tasked with designing and
    building a beam bridge out of matboard in a group of 3 or 4. Here is ours about to fail due to shear and buckling.
</p>

<p>We were given basic skeleton code, a design 0, a single sheet of matboard, contact cement, and a dream; a dream
    to reach the 1kN club. Our first objective was to write the code that would help us iterate our bridge design.
    I stepped up the most in this early phase by coding in Shear Force Diagrams and Bending Moment Diagrams
    for a given train car weight and train position, and then iterated it over all 1200 positions to make a plot for
    each max value at every point over all positions. Then as a team we coded our geometry in with variable cross-sections 
    and calculated our cross-sectional constants, stresses, and safety factors, plotted it all, graphed it, and it
    looks like this (These are the final graphs. As you can see we predicted our bridge would fail in compression.):

One thought I had during this project that I am proud of was about the material properties of matboard.
The references that we had to work on were mostly concrete, as box girders are. However, I noticed the
material properties were more similar to steel. Matboard does not have the compressive strength of
concrete, so I pitched my team reference designs made of steel and did hand calculations for our mostly
restrictive case that seemed promising.

<p>
Unfortunately, I thought of this rather late in our design process and we had pressure to start
construction due to time constraints. We also were unsure about the buckling case for our side legs
in the cross-section due to the unattached bottom in my proposal. We therefore made a team decision
to stick with our hyper-optimized box girder as opposed to this new design.

<p>
In terms of construction, I once again looked to reference designs. The class had a couple bridges
left over that had been previously destroyed in testing. This is the one that was good. It told us
splicing horizontally as opposed to vertically was a good idea and the diaphragm spacing was
incredibly important.

<p>In the end, our construction ended up being our downfall. Our bridge failed first
    in shear failure in the glue connected our top piece and then buckling once the glue failed.
    The matboard ended up being harder than we expected to fold, so the tabs in the side legs ended
    up having less surface on the top piece of our bridge to adhere to. Our bridge held around 700 N
    which unfortunately was around half of what we anticipated from our calculations, but it
    came with a valuable lesson: calculations are not the only thing that make up engineering.
