<h1>Rollator Project - Praxis 2</h1>
<main>
<h1>The GaitKeeper</h1>

<p>The GaitKeeper is the product of a semester-long design project in my Praxis 2 course during second semester. My group of four had the opportunity to work with the organization DANI
to design a rollator for a stakeholder who had a genetic disease causing physical disabilites.

The beginning of the project started with an RFP in which we developed a written report and a set of requirements from onsite visits, interviews and emails with 
stakeholders, and research. Our group's RFP was chosen out of a pool of roughly 80 other RFP's to be one of the 10 projects teams were assigned to. The particular 
report can be seen below: </p>

<p>During the design phase, we refined our requirements further with the objective of testability and determined the relative importance of them. We then split up
    brainstorming of the new system into subassemblies that could be individually brainstormed upon. I focused initially upon the method of movement, offering up new designs with 
    a focus on increased mobility while retaining stability. The main motivation behind this aim was due to current difficulty moving around in enclosed environments as well
    as maneuverability for actions such as getting into a car. This included concepts such as a spherical wheel, a wheel that could swivel when necessary, and finally a system
    of three wheels, emulating a wheelchairs rotational maneuverability.

<p> I also took on the responsibility of learning how to 3D model and perform structural simulations in Onshape. I simulated numerous frame designs and also modeled
    the final frame assembly. Below you can see the final assembly as well as the simulation of the final iteration of the frame, with the chosen material as Aluminum 
    6601-T6 as the standard in the rollator industry. One small feauture of this final product that I designed was the small handholds on the back of the rollator about halfway up.
    This would aid our stakeholder in getting up and down from chairs with greater stability.

<p>The final product was fully flushed out in our final design report as seen below. Our team then had the opportunity to present our design and process at a showcase event.
For this, I and another teamate created a prototype for the frame dimensions and shape. At this event, our final design was received positively by our stakeholders, and 
we were a finalist for the Rowe Award, a special award for teams who exhibit excellent team work and innovative stakeholder-centric design.</p>
