<h1>Clarke Prize Environmental Design Challenge</h1>

<p> I assembled a team of my friends to tackle the weekend-long 2024 Clarke Prize Environmental Design Challenge, our first ever team design challenge.
    It focused on the identification of an area for improvement in the sustainability efforts of the University or Toronto and the proposal of a solution.
</p>
<p>
    Our identified area of improvement was the lack of compost bins on campus with the exception of the ones in dining halls. From published data,
    the University sent 351 tons of uncomposted food waste to landfills in 2023, equating to 30.4 tons of methane gas emissions in a year. Additionally, UofT sends out 
    the compost it does collect to third-party companies with no control over what happens to it.
</p>

<p>This is a picture I took on the first night of the challenge in the Engineering Science common room when we were debated between different opportunities to address. Even 
    the bananas given to people in the challenge from the organizers of this sustainability event ended up in the trash.

<p>
    We decided that there was room for a new system that could help address this opportunity. Our proposed solution conisted of a greater compost collection network on campus, the retention
    of the currently disposed of compost, and the integration of an anaerobic digester outside of the Bahen building to feed into the campus steam plant. This would take in compost and turn it into fertilizer and biogas
     for the campus. The University of Toronto still uses natural gas to heat the campus
    through their steam plant, so we figured that a new biogas source would be able to cut the University's reliance on extracted fossil fuels and prevent the emissions from later
    decomposition in landfills.
</p>
<p>
    The proposed sytem would be able to process 3 tonnes of compost per day (All of the compost on campus), cost $1,000,000 to build, and produce 1728 KWh per day, 
    an energy equivalent the amount required to power the nearby Gerstein Library.

<p>The Design Challenge finished with a 5 minute presentation and a 5 minute Q&A session. We ended up placing first in our room of presentions (5 rooms) and top 10 overall out
     of around 40 teams. I actually believe we had a solid idea. Since we proposed this,
     I have seen a couple of compost bins pop up in some of our proposed locations.
