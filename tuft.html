<h1>Tuft Testing</h1>

<p>For my first project on the team, I was tasked with developing a tuft flow visualization
     plan and procedure for the aero team. I approached this project in three phases: research,
      testing, and then implementation. I researched quite a few flow visualization papers and
       youtube videos to eventually settle upon a length, color, material, and arrangment for the tufts. 
       Above you can see testing that I did with a hair dryer on my bathroom door. I determined 
       that 80mm long strands of orange cotton string in a hexagonal orientation were the most ideal 
       for my purposes. I also made sure to have both masking tape and refrigerator tape on hand just 
       in case the winter weather was a little too chilly for the adhesive. </p>

<p>I then decided to try to make the process as efficient as possible. I used an inch diameter dowel
     and cut a slit down it so I could wrap string around it and cut down the line, making uniform and
      time-efficient pieces of string. Then making a production line for the attachment and application.</p>

<p>Once I had my plan together and tools ready, it probably only took around 3-4 hours of time to cover half the car. One tricky spot was the array. After consulting our array lead, I decided to put the tufts on the diamonds that are formed in the corners of the array cells in order to not damage the array.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate on our testing weekend, so we were unable to drive the car at the time. However, I was still able to put together a reasonable and timely tufting procedure for future implementations. And you can still find some of these tufts around the shop..</p>
