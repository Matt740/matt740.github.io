<h1>Aerial E-Waste Detection System</h1>

<p> The Aerial E-Waste Detection System is a prototype drone-based waste scanning system aimed at aiding people who scavenge for valuable waste in
    landfills in Bangladesh. By providing the location of valuable waste to those who are looking for it, we can provide value by decreasing
    the amount of time they have to spend in hazardous conditions as well as increase their ability to make money.

<p>I worked on all of the systems of the AEDS except for the computer vision model. I helped develop the motor controllers,
 designed and simulated the structural frame of the drone, helped integrate the sensors and motor controllers into our Raspberry Pi's 
 I2C protocol, and also did a lot of the testing for the motors and propellers.</p>

<p>Here is a video of it flying:</p>
