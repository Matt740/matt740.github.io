<p> The Aerial E-Waste Detection System was a multistage project involving research, scoping, requirements, conceptual, and detailed design phases.
     The idea behind the
    project was that we could aid people who scavenged for valuable waste in Bangaladesh by giving them information on its location, 
    reducing the time they needed to be in trash heaps and enhancing their ability to collect the valuable waste. We decided to accomplish
    this with a drone-based system that would fly and detect trash below, saving the location and communicating it to those who needed it. 
    All of the information on each process can be found in our team drive above, but I will focus on my involvement with the
     detailed design phase for this page.
</p>

<p> The detailed design was split into 4 subsystems: control, mobility, structural, and detection. I worked on all except for the detection
    system.
